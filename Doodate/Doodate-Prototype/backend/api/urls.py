#The view paths, as defined in 'MODEL_MAPS' in views.function, have GET functions and DELETE functions
#URL path structure is as follows - '/api/ModelName/iDNum/' - add to end of local host for GET path
#To see a list of all same Models, path -> '/api/ModelName/0/'  - add to end of local host for GET path
#To use a DELETE request, use same structure with curl in command prompt (very not safe change if this is real)
#i.e 'curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost8000/api/ModelName/iDNum/'
